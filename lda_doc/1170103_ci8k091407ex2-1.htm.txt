Any
                notice required or permitted to be given to any of the parties to

                post,
                electronic facsimile transmission or other means of electronic

                her

                will
                be deemed to have been given and received by the party to whom it
                was
                addressed if mailed, on the third day following the mailing thereof,
                if by

13.10


This

13.11


If
                any covenant or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal,
                or
                incapable of being enforced by reason of any rule of law or public
                policy,
                then such covenant or other provision will be severed from and will
                not
                affect any other covenant or other provision of this Agreement, and
                this
                Agreement will be construed as if such invalid, illegal, or unenforceable
                covenant or provision had never been contained in this
                Agreement.  All other covenants and provisions of this Agreement
                will, nevertheless, remain in full force and effect and no covenant
                or
                provision will be deemed dependent upon any other covenant or provision
                unless so expressed herein.
